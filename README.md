Use the Reddit API to check wallstbets each day, store the number of mentions of
each stock in the top 25 rising results in a database, serve that data in the
form of an API, and use it to power a front-end App to couple those results with
those using another (indeterminate as of now) stock data API.

That about sums it up.
